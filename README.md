The Task was creating a e-commerce site using Java_ Script having the below features:
    1. There will be a list of products in any part of a web page
    2. Each product will have a price and there will be a button called Add to Cart
    3. You can show the cart at the bottom or left of the product list, the cart will be empty at the beginning
    4. Clicking on the Add to Cart button will add the product to the cart, the product will not be removed from the product list.
    5. Again there will be a Remove button next to the products in the cart, which will remove the product when clicked.
    6. Quantity, showing the total value is not mandatory
